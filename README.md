# Game Script :

Wizaring world game mimicks the harry potter fiction world, in which the main charater is played against 
the antagonist of the play.
the 4 bosses in the game would be : 
-- Professor Quirell, Basillisk -- both of them are Regular enemies
-- Professor Umbridge - mid-boss
-- Lord Voldemort -- Final Boss

The entire game would last approximately 2-3 minutes, 
making up of 4 phases: regular play with grunts; mid boss attack; more grunts; and final boss attack.

Default lives of the player would be 30 and it would gradually decerease if an attack is made from the enemies.
The enemies will have specific timeframe in the game, and if the player can escape attacks from enemies and survives
till the end of the game, then the player wins.
